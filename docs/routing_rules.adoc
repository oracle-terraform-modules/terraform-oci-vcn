When you create an Internet or a NAT gateway, terraform-oci-vcn modules automatically creates a dedicated route table for each gateway.

- `<label_prefix>-internet-route` route table is created if `create_internet_gateway = true`
- `<label_prefix>-nat-route` route table is created if `create_nat_gateway = true`

These automatically created route tables comes with automatic rules, that cannot be controlled by the module user.

== internet-route route table

internet-route is meant to be attached to public subnets you provision. It comes with one automatic/non-editable rule that redirects all unknown destination to the Internet Gateway created by this module: `0.0.0.0/0 --> Internet Gateway`.

== nat-route route table

nat-route table is meant to be attached to private subnets you provision. It comes with one automatic/non-editable rule that redirects all unknown destination to the NAT Gateway created by this module: `0.0.0.0/0 --> NAT Gateway`.

If a Service Gateway is also created by the module with `create_service_gateway = true`, a second rule is added to redirect all Oracle Network Services traffic to the Service Gateway created by this module: `All <REGION> services in OSN --> Service Gateway`

== Custom routes

terraform-oci-vcn modules have two optional Input Variables to inject user defined route rules into `internet-route` route table and `nat-route` route table using respectively:

- `internet_gateway_route_rules` defined as a `list(map(string))` with the following expected schema:

[source,hcl]
----
variable "internet_gateway_route_rules" {
  description = "(Updatable) List of routing rules to add to Internet Gateway Routing Table"
  type = list(object({
    destination       = string # required
    destination_type  = string # required
    network_entity_id = string # required
    description       = string # optional
  }))
  default = null
}
----

- `nat_gateway_route_rules` defined as a `list(map(string))` with the following expected schema:

[source,hcl]
----
variable "nat_gateway_route_rules" {
  description = "(Updatable) List of routing rules to add to NAT Gateway Routing Table"
  type = list(object({
    destination       = string # required
    destination_type  = string # required
    network_entity_id = string # required
    description       = string # optional
  }))
  default = null
}
----

They share the same schema but each Input Variable controls the associated route table:

- `destination` accept string value and represent the CIDR that will be affected by the rule,
- `destination_type` accept string value, with `CIDR_BLOCK` or `SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK` as valid values,
- `network_entity_id` accept string value and represent the gateway to be the target of the rule,
- `description` accept arbitrary string value and give context about the goal of the rule.

=== special values for `network_entity_id`

For routing rules targeting a Gateway created by the module, `network_entity_id` accepts some special strings to automatically retrieve the gateway ocid.

- `internet_gateway_route_rules` and `nat_gateway_route_rules` recognise the `"drg"` string and resolve it to the DRG ocid attached to the module (if available),
- `internet_gateway_route_rules` recognise the `"internet_gateway"` string and resolve it to the Internet Gateway ocid created by the module,
- `nat_gateway_route_rules` recognise the `"nat_gateway"` string and resolve it to the NAT Gateway ocid created by the module.

=== generic values for `network_entity_id`

If you need to create a routing rule with a target gateway created outside of the module, you can simply provide the resource OCID using a valid Terraform method (any {uri-tf-namedvalues}[Named Value]).

== Examples
