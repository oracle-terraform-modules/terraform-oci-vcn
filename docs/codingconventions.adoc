= Coding conventions

This is a list of coding conventions you should observe when contributting code for this project.

Addressed subjects are the following:

- adopting the right case type
- good names for files and variables

It is not an exhaustive list and it will be updated as we go. In the mean time, your PR reviewer may suggest conventions that are not listed here. Please update.

== Names

- Use snake_case when naming variables and resources
- If your variable is controlling a behaviour, use imperative style to name it e.g. create_internet_gateway
- Use simple file names where possible; avoid '-', '' for terraform files. '' is ok for bash/python.
